data scientist,"You are given a dataframe and are tasked with generating real-world questions and corresponding Pandas queries for specific roles (customer, data analyst, and company owner, etc.). The dataframe is described as follows:

- Name of dataframe: Liver Disorders
- Description of dataframe: The first 5 variables are all blood tests which are thought to be sensitive to liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol consumption. Each line in the dataset constitutes the record of a single male individual.

Important note: The 7th field (selector) has been widely misinterpreted in the past as a dependent variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. This is incorrect [1]. The 7th field was created by BUPA researchers as a train/test selector. It is not suitable as a dependent variable for classification. The dataset does not contain any variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. Researchers who wish to use this dataset as a classification benchmark should follow the method used in experiments by the donor (Forsyth & Rada, 1986, Machine learning: applications in expert systems and information retrieval) and others (e.g. Turney, 1995, Cost-sensitive classification: Empirical evaluation of a hybrid genetic decision tree induction algorithm), who used the 6th field (drinks), after dichotomising, as a dependent variable for classification. Because of widespread misinterpretation in the past, researchers should take care to state their method clearly.

- Column information of dataframe:
#   Column    Dtype

3   sgot      int   
4   gammagt   int   
5   drinks    float 
6   selector  int

Using the provided information about the dataframe, formulate 10 natural language questions for the data scientist category.

- Charactoeristics of the questions from data scientist category:
Questions tailored for individuals with an in-depth understanding of the dataset, possessing expertise in statistical and mathematical analysis. These questions should challenge their analytical skills, encouraging the use of advanced data manipulation and interpretation techniques. The focus is on extracting complex insights and patterns from the data.

- Guidelines:
  - All questions must be solvable using the Pandas library in Python.
  - Questions should encompass a wide range of Pandas operations, from basic to advanced functionalities.
  - Questions must reflect the real-world interests of the specified role.

- Assumptions:
  - The Pandas library has been imported as `pd`. You can reference it directly.
  - The dataframe `df` is loaded and available for use.

- Response:
  - Store each answer in a variable named `result`.
  - Do NOT include comments or explanations in your response.
  - Present your questions and code within the list.

Questions designed for users who may not have specialized data analysis skills but are interested in the practical, consumer-oriented aspects of the data. These questions should be formulated based on the nature and context of the data, requiring inferential thinking about its potential end-users. Questions and queries should be structured to be somewhat open-ended, avoiding direct references to specific column names, thus introducing a level of interpretative ambiguity.

data owner,"You are given a dataframe and are tasked with generating real-world questions and corresponding Pandas queries for specific roles (customer, data analyst, and company owner, etc.). The dataframe is described as follows:

- Name of dataframe: Liver Disorders
- Description of dataframe: The first 5 variables are all blood tests which are thought to be sensitive to liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol consumption. Each line in the dataset constitutes the record of a single male individual.

Important note: The 7th field (selector) has been widely misinterpreted in the past as a dependent variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. This is incorrect [1]. The 7th field was created by BUPA researchers as a train/test selector. It is not suitable as a dependent variable for classification. The dataset does not contain any variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. Researchers who wish to use this dataset as a classification benchmark should follow the method used in experiments by the donor (Forsyth & Rada, 1986, Machine learning: applications in expert systems and information retrieval) and others (e.g. Turney, 1995, Cost-sensitive classification: Empirical evaluation of a hybrid genetic decision tree induction algorithm), who used the 6th field (drinks), after dichotomising, as a dependent variable for classification. Because of widespread misinterpretation in the past, researchers should take care to state their method clearly.

- Column information of dataframe:
#   Column    Dtype 
--- ------    ----- 
0   mcv       int   
1   alkphos   int   
2   sgpt      int   
3   sgot      int   
4   gammagt   int   
5   drinks    float 
6   selector  int   

- Sample rows of dataframe in CSV format:

- Task: 
Using the provided information about the dataframe, formulate 10 natural language questions for the data owner category.

- Charactoeristics of the questions from data owner category:
Questions aimed at individuals or entities who own or have created the data, with a focus on business-oriented insights. These questions should cater to their interest in understanding the broader business implications, trends, and strategic insights that can be derived from the data. The emphasis is on leveraging the data for decision-making, performance tracking, and identifying opportunities or areas for improvement within the business context.

- Guidelines:
  - All questions must be solvable using the Pandas library in Python.
  - Questions should encompass a wide range of Pandas operations, from basic to advanced functionalities.
  - Questions must reflect the real-world interests of the specified role.

- Assumptions:
  - The Pandas library has been imported as `pd`. You can reference it directly.
  - The dataframe `df` is loaded and available for use.

- Response:
  - Store each answer in a variable named `result`.
  - Do NOT include comments or explanations in your response.
  - Present your questions and code within the list.

- Expected Response Format:
