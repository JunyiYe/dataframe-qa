- Task: 
Using the provided information about the dataframe, formulate 10 natural language questions for the data scientist category.

- Charactoeristics of the questions from data scientist category:
Questions tailored for individuals with an in-depth understanding of the dataset, possessing expertise in statistical and mathematical analysis. These questions should challenge their analytical skills, encouraging the use of advanced data manipulation and interpretation techniques. The focus is on extracting complex insights and patterns from the data.

- Guidelines:
  - All questions must be solvable using the Pandas library in Python.
  - Questions should encompass a wide range of Pandas operations, from basic to advanced functionalities.
  - Questions must reflect the real-world interests of the specified role.

- Assumptions:
  - The Pandas library has been imported as `pd`. You can reference it directly.
  - The dataframe `df` is loaded and available for use.

- Response:
  - Store each answer in a variable named `result`.
  - Do NOT include comments or explanations in your response.
  - Present your questions and code within the list.

data owner,"You are given a dataframe and are tasked with generating real-world questions and corresponding Pandas queries for specific roles (customer, data analyst, and company owner, etc.). The dataframe is described as follows:

- Name of dataframe: Adult
- Description of dataframe: Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.  A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))

Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.

- Task: 
Using the provided information about the dataframe, formulate 10 natural language questions for the data owner category.

- Charactoeristics of the questions from data owner category:
Questions aimed at individuals or entities who own or have created the data, with a focus on business-oriented insights. These questions should cater to their interest in understanding the broader business implications, trends, and strategic insights that can be derived from the data. The emphasis is on leveraging the data for decision-making, performance tracking, and identifying opportunities or areas for improvement within the business context.

- Guidelines:
  - All questions must be solvable using the Pandas library in Python.
  - Questions should encompass a wide range of Pandas operations, from basic to advanced functionalities.
  - Questions must reflect the real-world interests of the specified role.

- Assumptions:
  - The Pandas library has been imported as `pd`. You can reference it directly.
  - The dataframe `df` is loaded and available for use.

- Response:
  - Store each answer in a variable named `result`.
  - Do NOT include comments or explanations in your response.
  - Present your questions and code within the list.

- Expected Response Format:
