data scientist,"You are given a dataframe and are tasked with generating real-world questions and corresponding Pandas queries for specific roles (customer, data analyst, and company owner, etc.). The dataframe is described as follows:

- Name of dataframe: Car Evaluation
- Description of dataframe: Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX, M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:

CAR                      car acceptability
. PRICE                  overall price
. . buying               buying price
. . maint                price of the maintenance
. TECH                   technical characteristics
. . COMFORT              comfort
. . . doors              number of doors
. . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
. . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
. . safety               estimated safety of the car

Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.

Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

- Task: 
Using the provided information about the dataframe, formulate 10 natural language questions for the data scientist category.

- Charactoeristics of the questions from data scientist category:
Questions tailored for individuals with an in-depth understanding of the dataset, possessing expertise in statistical and mathematical analysis. These questions should challenge their analytical skills, encouraging the use of advanced data manipulation and interpretation techniques. The focus is on extracting complex insights and patterns from the data.

- Guidelines:
  - All questions must be solvable using the Pandas library in Python.
  - Questions should encompass a wide range of Pandas operations, from basic to advanced functionalities.
  - Questions must reflect the real-world interests of the specified role.

- Assumptions:
  - The Pandas library has been imported as `pd`. You can reference it directly.
  - The dataframe `df` is loaded and available for use.

- Response:
  - Store each answer in a variable named `result`.
  - Do NOT include comments or explanations in your response.
  - Present your questions and code within the list.

- Expected Response Format:

- Charactoeristics of the questions from general user category:
Questions designed for users who may not have specialized data analysis skills but are interested in the practical, consumer-oriented aspects of the data. These questions should be formulated based on the nature and context of the data, requiring inferential thinking about its potential end-users. Questions and queries should be structured to be somewhat open-ended, avoiding direct references to specific column names, thus introducing a level of interpretative ambiguity.

- Guidelines:
  - All questions must be solvable using the Pandas library in Python.
  - Questions should encompass a wide range of Pandas operations, from basic to advanced functionalities.
  - Questions must reflect the real-world interests of the specified role.

data owner,"You are given a dataframe and are tasked with generating real-world questions and corresponding Pandas queries for specific roles (customer, data analyst, and company owner, etc.). The dataframe is described as follows:

- Name of dataframe: Car Evaluation
- Description of dataframe: Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX, M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:

CAR                      car acceptability
. PRICE                  overall price
. . buying               buying price
. . maint                price of the maintenance
. TECH                   technical characteristics
. . COMFORT              comfort
. . . doors              number of doors
. . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
. . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
. . safety               estimated safety of the car

Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.

Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

- Column information of dataframe:
#   Column    Dtype 
--- ------    ----- 
0   buying    str   
1   maint     str   
2   doors     str   
3   persons   str   
4   lug_boot  str   
5   safety    str   
6   class     str   

- Sample rows of dataframe in CSV format:

med,high,4,4,big,med,acc
vhigh,med,2,4,big,high,acc

- Task: 
Using the provided information about the dataframe, formulate 10 natural language questions for the data owner category.

- Charactoeristics of the questions from data owner category:
Questions aimed at individuals or entities who own or have created the data, with a focus on business-oriented insights. These questions should cater to their interest in understanding the broader business implications, trends, and strategic insights that can be derived from the data. The emphasis is on leveraging the data for decision-making, performance tracking, and identifying opportunities or areas for improvement within the business context.

- Guidelines:
  - All questions must be solvable using the Pandas library in Python.
  - Questions should encompass a wide range of Pandas operations, from basic to advanced functionalities.
  - Questions must reflect the real-world interests of the specified role.

- Assumptions:
  - The Pandas library has been imported as `pd`. You can reference it directly.
  - The dataframe `df` is loaded and available for use.

- Response:
  - Store each answer in a variable named `result`.
  - Do NOT include comments or explanations in your response.
  - Present your questions and code within the list.

- Expected Response Format:
